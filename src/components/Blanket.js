        The Blanket Project explores the intersection of technology and comfort,
        creating interactive experiences that respond to human touch and
        presence.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project investigates how everyday objects can be enhanced with
        technology to create more meaningful and responsive interactions,
        focusing on the tactile and emotional aspects of human-computer
        interaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through innovative sensor technology and responsive materials, the
        Blanket Project aims to create a new paradigm for interactive design
        that prioritizes comfort, accessibility, and emotional connection.
